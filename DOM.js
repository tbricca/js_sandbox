////////// TRAVERSING THE DOM ///////// 
/// What is the DOM? --- it is the DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
// Structured representation of an html document
// Cna be thought of as a tree of nodes or elements (any of the html tags) created by the browser
// Can use javascript to read/write/manipulate to the DOM
// It is Object Oriented - meaning - that each node has its own set of properties or methods 
// that we can add, change, remove 
// Browser gives us a window object, inside that we have a document object (the loaded webpage)

// not using jQuery makes it faster becasuse there's no overhead of the additional library 

/////////////////// EXAMINING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT //////////////////////////////////////
